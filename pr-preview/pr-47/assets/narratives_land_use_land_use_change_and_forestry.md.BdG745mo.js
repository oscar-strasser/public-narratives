The data support authorities in their National Inventory Reports (NIR) for reporting of anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas emissions and removals, building on the methodology developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The LULUCF maps were produced by GeoVille Information Systems and Data Processing GmbH by means of a deep learning U-Net automated supervised classification algorithm and quality assessed by visual interpretation, with an Overall Accuracy of 97%.</p><p>Developed within FFG project ‘GHG-KIT’ [contract #FO999893432]</p><p><a href="https://ghg-kit.at/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://ghg-kit.at/</a></p>',5)]))}const p=e(n,[["render",i]]);export{h as __pageData,p as default};
