As we focus exclusively on the built environment, we employ advanced spatial clustering algorithms to minimize the area of interest, creating an optimal trade-off between coverage and cost. We offer a two-step approach to building footprint monitoring:</p><ol><li><em>Monitoring based on Copernicus Sentinel II data</em>: This cost-effective solution covers wide areas and focuses primarily on change detection. This approach is particularly valuable for the GTIF capability &quot;urban heat islands - trend analysis,&quot; where understanding changes in the built environment helps predict heat island trends.</li><li><em>Detailed extraction from high-resolution data</em>: This premium service provides precise building footprints, detects new buildings, identifies changes to existing structures (such as extensions), and recognizes obsolete buildings.</li></ol><p>Both approaches can be combined in a workflow where changes are first detected using the monitoring service, and detailed information is extracted only for areas of interest. A decision layer can be implemented between these steps to trigger detailed extraction only when a certain threshold of changes is detected. Our pricing structure depends on the selected modules:</p><ul><li>Low for monitoring services</li><li>Medium for footprint extraction, with pricing dependent on the required precision</li><li>Premium for services requiring human validation</li></ul><h3 id="free-version" tabindex="-1">Free Version <a class="header-anchor" href="#free-version" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Free Version&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A basic version of the Building Footprints service is available free of charge with limited functionality:</p><ul><li>Lower resolution monitoring</li><li>Limited update frequency</li><li>Restricted area coverage</li><li>Basic visualization abilities</li></ul><h3 id="commercial-versions" tabindex="-1">Commercial Versions <a class="header-anchor" href="#commercial-versions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Commercial Versions&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Our commercial offerings provide enhanced capabilities:</p><p><em>Standard Package</em></p><ul><li>Monitoring based on Sentinel II data</li><li>Quarterly updates</li><li>Basic change detection</li><li>Standard visualization abilities</li></ul><p><em>Professional Package</em></p><ul><li>Combined monitoring and detailed extraction</li><li>Monthly updates</li><li>Advanced change detection</li><li>Comprehensive visualization and analysis abilities</li><li>API access for integration with other systems</li></ul><p><em>Enterprise Package</em></p><ul><li>Custom monitoring and extraction solutions</li><li>Customizable update frequency</li><li>Human-validated results</li><li>Advanced analytics and reporting</li><li>Dedicated support</li></ul><h3 id="network-of-resources" tabindex="-1">Network of Resources <a class="header-anchor" href="#network-of-resources" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Network of Resources&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The Building Footprints service will be registered with the ESA Network of Resources, making it eligible for ESA sponsoring for pre-commercial utilization.
