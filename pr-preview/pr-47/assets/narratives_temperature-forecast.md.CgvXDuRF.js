So-called heat hotspots arise particularly in densely built-up and heavily sealed areas. This problem particularly affects vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children and people with chronic illnesses. In winter, on the other hand, severe frost can lead to cold deaths and other dangers, especially in traffic (black ice).</p><p>Weather-related health risks are increasing, as does the need especially for cooling but also for heating of buildings, thus challenging the energy suppliers. The importance of precise weather forecasts, especially in urban areas, is therefore growing rapidly.</p><h2 id="our-solution-tailor-made-high-resolution-temperature-forecasts-for-your-city" tabindex="-1">Our solution: tailor-made high-resolution temperature forecasts for your city <a class="header-anchor" href="#our-solution-tailor-made-high-resolution-temperature-forecasts-for-your-city" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Our solution: tailor-made high-resolution temperature forecasts for your city&quot;">​</a></h2><p>GeoSphere Austria is working with the latest technology to forecast urban weather phenomena more accurately than typically available. By integrating precise satellite-based (e.g. Sentinel 2) land cover data and additional information, the air temperature and derived variables can be calculated on a 100-meter grid. The need for such a fine grid spacing is represented in Fig. 2. To be able to do planning on the district level, the poutput of current global and local weather models (10-1km) is not sufficient. This advanced model approach helps not only the public, but also actors in the State Crisis and Disaster Management (SKKM) to respond to potential dangers more quickly and efficiently. In addition, the forecasts can be used to predict heating or cooling requirements. The more detailed the temperature forecast, the more accurately the energy requirement can be estimated to increase the efficiency of energy supplier systems. <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/428d4891-20d9-4b60-a045-3fc4e53a0e16" alt="Fig1_resolution"></p><p><em>Fig. 2: Urban structures that can be distinguished on different spatial scales.</em></p><h2 id="technical-features-of-the-product" tabindex="-1">Technical features of the product <a class="header-anchor" href="#technical-features-of-the-product" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Technical features of the product&quot;">​</a></h2><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>spatial gridding</td><td>100m</td></tr><tr><td>temporal gridding</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>forecast range</td><td>+30 hours</td></tr><tr><td>forecast time</td><td>00 UTC</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Model domain is either based on data created by us or based on your data that you can provide from your city.</p><h2 id="organizational-details-and-legal-information" tabindex="-1">Organizational details and legal information <a class="header-anchor" href="#organizational-details-and-legal-information" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Organizational details and legal information&quot;">​</a></h2><p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4a90124-22af-4c13-b659-f91991b36d0d" alt="GSA_Basislogo_Positiv_RGB_XXS"></p><p>Contact points: <a href="mailto:brigitta.hollosi@geosphere.at" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Brigitta Hollosi</a>, <a href="mailto:stefan.schneider@geosphere.at" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Stefan Schneider</a></p><p><em>Available services:</em></p><ol><li><strong>Free version:</strong> During project runtime, example forecasts are available for selected Austrian cities.
